	<p>A very reliable Battle Station that can destroy those Rebel scum whenever they appear at your doorstep! This Imperial symbol will cause all of your enemies to run away in fear and unite in rebellion to stop you! But don't worry, we got you covered because the Death Star has many qualities such as:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Being a massive Battle Station; that's no moon!</li>
		<li>Only having one weakness!</li>
		<li>Being really good at shooting things; especially planets!</li>	
		<li>It's Alderaan approved!</li>
		<li>And if your Death Star blows up? Get a second Death Star free!</li>	
		</ul>
